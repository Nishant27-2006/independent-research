# Independent Research Projects by Nishant Gadde

Hello! I’m Nishant Gadde, a passionate student from Katy, Texas, deeply interested in the intersections of data science, computer science, and machine learning. This repository showcases my journey, starting from my freshman year when I first began applying machine learning algorithms to real-world data. These projects represent how I’ve grown in this field, fueled by a desire to find meaningful insights from data and solve complex problems.

## How It All Started

My passion for machine learning and data science began during my freshman year in high school when I joined the **Investment Club**. There, I had the opportunity to work with financial data, where we analyzed stock market trends and built early prediction models. I soon realized the power of machine learning in making sense of complex datasets and improving decision-making.

As a key member and later a mentor, I took the initiative to **educate over 150 students** in the club, helping them understand the basics of financial markets and the potential of data science in investment strategies. I developed workshops and tutorials to introduce students to coding, data analysis, and the exciting world of machine learning.

During this time, I began conducting independent research, gathering data not only from the financial markets but also from school facilities and various community projects. I started applying machine learning models to optimize resource allocation, predict outcomes, and solve real-world problems, ranging from finance to healthcare and beyond.

## Sharing Knowledge: Publications and Contributions

Beyond the Investment Club, my research work expanded into new areas, including predictive maintenance, medical data analysis, and federated learning. I was fortunate enough to **publish my findings in several academic journals**, where I shared my work on machine learning algorithms and their practical applications in areas like medical diagnostics and predictive analytics.

By the end of my sophomore year, I had published articles on topics such as:
- **Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning**: This study explored how data-driven models can anticipate machine failures and reduce downtime in industrial environments.
- **Medical Diagnostics with Machine Learning**: My work applied ML algorithms to detect heart disease and other health issues, improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
- **Federated Learning for Data Privacy**: I also explored how decentralized learning models can protect user privacy while enabling machine learning at scale.

My publications have helped others in the field explore new avenues for applying machine learning to practical, real-world problems.

## About Me

I’m dedicated to exploring the endless possibilities of data science and machine learning. My focus is on how these technologies can drive innovation across a wide range of fields, including medicine, business, and more. Each project in this repository reflects my curiosity, dedication, and desire to push the boundaries of technology to create impactful solutions.
